<h1 align="center">Hello There!!!</h1>

I am CocoaMilka, a Computer Science major and 2D/3D artist currently attending Missouri S&T! I love code and sharks and XR! Below you can find some of my projects and list of skills :3

Currently most of my work is within unity, developing VR/AR applications as well as shaders. I create my own models and textures for most of my projects.
